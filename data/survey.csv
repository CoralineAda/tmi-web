I just stick to my religion. Copingwise, I'm not sure if this is coping however I meditate everymorning for 10 minutes, say affirmations for 10 minutes, visualize for 10 minutes read for 10 minutes and write what I see for 10 minutes. Since I have children now it doesn't always get finished but I always have time to meditate.

I must be honest, I haven't learned much about gender theory.  However, I believe people should just be allowed to live a free life as long as they aren't hurting anyone else. I grew up around mostly women all of my life and had a strong father figure. He was a political refugee and a soldier from his country, and whenever I was being picked on for being mixed, if I were to show any weakness, he would tell me, rather than be upset, if someone attacks you don't just stand there do something about it.  So, I started to fight back. First few times I had 3 or 4 kids attack me and I'd get beat up really badly. I was around 9 years old and I started to do push ups, pull ups and exercise with my dad. He showed me a couple of moves  And one day something clicked I was attacked by 3 bullies at once in my neighborhood, they were bigger than me I successfully beat two of the three up and the third one ran away. From then on, I became confident for years the beat me up and once I became stronger I was not only left along but respected. With that experience in my life, I honestly think it's human nature. No amount of talking or kindness I tried to show worked, I would get beat up and spit on and when I finally was able to overpower my bullies they left me alone and perhaps moved on to an easier target. So moving forward more than 30 something years later, I've learned to assess life and positions as pros and cons. I'm perceived as a black male and it helps in some situations, and in others pose some challenges. But when it comes down to it that's the nature of humans. For example when I go to my moms country I don't look south east asian, however, there are times where I speak the language and just because I look black people treat me much better than they would have if I weren't mix for being able to speak the language. I went to a restaurant with my wife and friend, the lady said our wait was going to be over an hour. I spoke the language and showed a pick when I was a monk, and we were seated in 5 minutes.

As much as I would like to go deeper into that space, I have a wife kids, mortgages, contracts, interviews, jobs, learning financial hacks and investments too much of that to go into that space. Another thing for me is I see it as dividing us more into subcategories. I've been categorized my whole life,  so I personally just like to see people as people and call individuals by their name rather than their gender or label people by sexual preference. For me sexual preferences don't even matter because I'm married with children lol, I'm out of the market so it has nothing to do with me at this point haha. ",,"I think, that as people it would be nice to just enjoy one another and be comfortable in our own skin.

My wife is Hindu, mom is Buddhist, father was Roman Catholic, step mother Baptist and Stepfather was Jewish that became an Atheist. I been to church, temples and the synagogue ( step cousins ).

When a society enters the secondary sector, conservative attitudes tend to change. Because industrial manufacturing involves a lot of skill, such as drawing blueprints, women's work output is not significantly inferior to men's.

When a society enters the tertiary sector, it becomes more diverse, and women's rights are greatly enhanced. For example, female teachers and bank service personnel are generally more patient and personable than males."

Identity, to me, is a dynamic interplay of both empowerment and vulnerability. It's a journey where personal growth often stems from embracing diverse experiences and perspectives. I believe open and respectful conversations about identity foster understanding, creating a space where individuals can share their unique stories. Through empathy and appreciation for differences, we can build a more inclusive and compassionate world that celebrates the richness of our collective identities.

However, Immediately before starting this corporate job, I grew up my entire life in a lower middle class, and at times working class family, and went through college as a working class individual. ","I experienced some classism while I was in college earning my bachelor's degree, and still see some remnants of it now. While getting my undergraduate degree I had no financial support from my family so I was on several scholarships and government grants, had to take out student loans, and worked 2-3 jobs throughout the school year. I attended a private university where a majority of students did not need scholarships, grants, or student loans, and did not work at all while attending school. As a result of this, I had a few occasions where I had to miss out on social activities because I had to work or I didn't have the money to participate. There were several years where all of my friends went on an expensive vacation for spring break and could not understand why I couldn't attend and kept insisting I just have my parents pay for it. I actively tried to hide details about my family life while I was in school because of this. I wouldn't invite people to visit me over the summers because I thought they would make fun of my family's house, I would save up all my money to buy one name brand item of clothing and wear that as often as I could, or I would try to avoid questions about my home life or make excuses for why I did not have a passport or never went on vacations. I also only posted pictures on social media of me in nice coffee shops or hanging out at parks or things like that so it would look like I did more than just work and school all the time. ","I am caucasian ","I have not personally experienced racism, but I have seen some forms of it in college. I went to a primarily white college and most people of color who I knew or interacted with went by nicknames. Since graduating college and working in a corporate job, I have seen a lot less of this as minority groups have become more equal in numbers to white employees. ","I grew up in a christian family, but since moving out I have not thought of religion a lot. I have not attended church or been in any religious groups, but I don't think that there's no higher power. I think I would consider myself agnostic. ","Honestly I haven't been in professional settings where people have expressed their religious beliefs before. I knew my roommates in college were lutheran but we never really talked about it, they just went to church on Sundays and I stayed home. Otherwise, I don't know the religious beliefs of any of my coworkers and didn't know the religious beliefs of almost any of my undergrad classmates. Since I was primarily in technology classes, I think it was never in the realm of being related to class content and therefore was never brought up. ","I am hard of hearing. I would almost consider it an invisible disability because it does not impact my speech and with my hearing aids, which are completely covered by my hair, it's not clear that I'm straining to hear people. ","I have not experienced blatant ableism, and I frequently tell people about my disability. It's never been something that I've felt embarrassed of or felt the need to hide. That being said, there are some things I naturally do in order to adjust for my needs without having to seek help from other people. My hearing aids sit behind my ears and are only visible from the back of my head. Most people do not know I have a disability because I keep my hair down everyday and therefore the hearing aids are hidden. When I do put my hair up when I'm at the gym or playing volleyball with friends, I typically take my hearing aids out because I don't want to have to explain to people what they are. It's surprising how often strangers will ask what are in my ears when they see them for the first time. Additionally, I typically try to find solutions for situations where I'm struggling by myself and only escalate it if I have to. I always turn captions on when I'm watching videos, TV, or in a zoom call. However, I never ask for captioning devices in movie theaters and just accept the fact that I might not understand everything. During the pandemic, I had an incredibly difficult time succeeding in school because I rely heavily on lip reading and everyone wore masks. I didn't want to draw attention to my disability at this time so I would record the class in person, bring the recording home and turn on captions, and watch it again so I could try to understand what had happened. ","I would not described myself as neurodivergent, but in the past I have had some semi-severe anxiety","I have not experienced neurodivergent discrimination and have not been close enough with any neurodivergent people to understand their struggles with prejudice.

While the issue of sexism in technology is being addressed by companys and is much better than it was many years ago, I have still dealt with it many times. I was the only female worker in my first 4 internships and even in my current job, where about 30% of our tech positions are held my women, I have noticed having to push harder and be more assertive than my male coworkers to get engineers to work with me. I have a name that is clearly female and a profile picture that shows my feminine appearance, so withdrawing or hiding my identity is not an option. Typically people work with me well, but i have worked with a few men who don't take me seriously, and have had to cc my manager or other male coworkers onto emails to get timely responses.

my developmental background has be characterized by financial struggles, my parents worked in blue collar jobs for long hours. Despite facing economic challenges, I was able to fulfill my career goals and now my income exceeds the national average for individuals within my age group. ","I didn't know what healthy coping mechanisms were until I finished my undergrad degree. Since I was kid till later in college years I had already accepted that people with more resources are allowed to make me feel little (sadly) and I was in this constant survival mode specially through people pleasing behaviors.. growing up as a tan Mexican girl with an accent is an extra challenge... I didn't want to fall in the ""bad stereotype"" people have so I tried really hard to make myself small, invisible, please everyone to avoid trouble.
There were multiple events that happened to me and witnessing the hardships that my parents faced like being denied purchasing a sofa because of their accent or really sketchy practices from their higher ups to slave them at work ... I hit a point in life where I thought this was not worth living and had suicidal thoughts because no matter how good people we are .. people were still terrible... and  I thank my young self for reaching out to a women center and meeting really wonderful people who helped me go through my mental difficulties and they taught healthy coping mechanisms like: 
- Mindfulness 
- Group therapies 
- practicing boundaries 
- how to recognize signs of anxiety 
- how to soothe my body when entering fight,  flight, or freeze.  

My first therapist told me that if i kept doing my best to heal internally she promised me I would rise as strong and determined woman. While, I am still doing the inner work I can see how much healthy coping mechanisms changed my outlook and allowed me to finish my studies accordingly to give my best shot at getting the resources that I needed.  
Can't change how people treat me but i changed my mindset to ""I am enough and I am still learning"" ","This one is hard.... because I speak Spanish and my parents are of a mixed-heritage of Mexicans I fall under Hispanic or Latina ... but to be honest I always feel uncomfortable checking that box .... Like stated above race and ethnicity are complex social constructs ... and the Hispanic population is HUGE and often times i feel i don't belong there and i don't like having a label that is mis-representative and influences several things that aren't related to medical conditions. ","Nowadays I stay with my close relationships to live my normal life so if we go to a restaurant (for example) and I catch on an unusual behavior it is good to have someone there to check if they noticed it too and me not just imagining things so if it gets validated we wait and until that person shows that unusual behavior to question it on the moment like ""what makes you say something like that?""

I have been diagnosed as depressed and almost diagnosed with other things but I think there is still fear and stigma deep down that I didn't want to carry that marker.

","I have just been told that it may be more beneficial to not have an official diagnosis but to still be aware of my behaviors and symptoms for myself as a diagnosis could impede one in the future. ","I think I am neurodivergent. I used to always describe myself as awkward, and in my early 20s I was much more reliant on substances to function in social settings. Sometimes I would say something and it was read as a joke, or sometimes I would say something and it could be read as mean, but I was just being honest and I didn't realize the larger impact of what I was saying until I was told. It's strange to me because I felt I've always been hyper aware of how to jump in to conversations, concentrating on a response, and trying to follow cues but it was stressful and felt like a lot of work. So when things were weird like the laughs or someone said something was mean I was surprised because I felt like I took great care in what I was saying, but sometimes I would just miss an element here and there. I've always been hypervigilant because my dad was more emotionally abusive, but I think that helped me in searching for clues in social settings, even if it gives me great anxiety. 
I don't rely on substances anymore, I don't go out to places If I don't feel like it. I build bumpers in my day so I can take care of myself and cope with schedule changes. I find comfort in my morning and evening routines and keep to myself but I found this has given me the least anxiety and less energy drain. 
As I try to recall symptoms I also find that I'm lessening them but I'll try to list them without talking myself out of them. Some things off the top of my head are movements, like moving my feet and hands. I carry my arms in a t rex way. I used to have to move my feet to fall asleep but now I only do it if I really need to. 
Sometimes I can listen to the same song all day, there is just something about an emersion of an experience that I really enjoy if I really love a song. I feel like I want to relive each part I focus on and if something interupts me I need to listen again. If I feel like I need to focus or I'm tired I turn off all sound and lower it rly low, for like directions, when driving.

I think I would lean into femininity or stereotypes would lend itself to me, and I wasn't afraid to ask questions, so I think this would lead to the same effect.

I take time to learn spanish daily, I've studied mexican american history, and my own genealogy; I know why things are the way they are and I'm proud of the history that has me here living my own experience. 
Socially the same, I pursue my interests without others in mind, and even if I get a nagging feeling sometimes that maybe I'm being weird, I can cope and know that's not a measure of fulfillment I want to abide by. 
I used to feel like I wasn't enough in so many ways, but I know who I am and what I want, in the pursuit of those things I will always be enough.  "

We have ups and downs, accomplishments and scars from life, but they make us different and we're constantly growing and changing, so our identity isn't necessarily always constant. But certain parts of our identity may stay constant- such as where we came from, our roots, our upbringing, our family, our loved ones. Other things such as our interests, our beliefs, goals, and values may change through time and I feel that the component of change is what's empowering yet vulnerable at the same time. We can never be sure of how the future looks and what we may mold into, but the things are are constant in life can sort of of ground us as we keep evolving our identity. Different identities coming together in this world to combine our knowledge and power to make change for the better is a profound thing that we sometimes forget to appreciate. Instead, we may discriminate and hate on others who are different from us, but that type of ignorance is the exact roadblock that keeps us from evolving into better identities together."

","I always code switch, I go by a different name in school settings, and rarely mention that I am unemployed to classmates or professors, If asked, I either lie or frame it differently like, ""I am looking to transition to internships"" or ""I am interested in switching fields and have been considering career changes"", which I guess are half truths. ","I am Christian, but not traditional in any regard. I have a real spiritual connection with God, but I don't go to church, pray regularly or refrain from cursing, etc. Also as a queer, non binary person and a feminist, I only agree with the non toxic beliefs in the religion, that weren't tampered by toxic White Male tyrants. Also I believe in science. So yeah, if all that's still Christian...then I'm Christian. (lol)","As a ""Christian"" or at least my version of it I've only experienced prejudice from other Christians that are homophobic, fat phobic, transphobic, racist, sexist, or what not. It honestly doesn't bother me much anymore, I don't have coping mechanisms. In these situations, I remain indifferent, & just ignore them or report them if I can, anonymously . ","I am disabled. I have Hidradentis Suppuritiva, which is a very a painful skin condition that impedes my mobility. ","I never tell anyone about my disability. I am lucky its not very visible to the public, I can easily hide it with clothing. With my condition, its hard to control body odors, and this is not correlated to poor hygiene. People with HS arguably have the best hygiene practices and actually have to buy either medical grade or natural, high quality soaps, deodorants and lotions. 

However, people and even doctors assume folks with HS, are dirty and even promiscuous. I was told at the age of 12, that I had herpes, even though I explained multiple times I was just a kid, not sexually active. 

So my coping mechanisms, include only seeing Black Women dermatologists for my condition, staying in during flares, therapy and never mentioning it to people, ever.  ",I have ADHD and Dyslexia.,"I work very hard to sound smart and proof read everything I write. I mask in class all the time, and am constantly fidgeting with fidget toys during lecture as I find it damn near impossible to stay seated for 3 hours. I watch lectures asynchronously if I can, like podcasts. I am in school to become an UX Researcher, but a large part of this involves reading difficult, dense literature studies. So I recently bought Speechify and now Snoop Dog reads me all my academic papers, haha. ","I am Non Binary, I feel that I am some mix of both masculine and feminine energy, or possibly neither. I am not really into labels. ","I withdraw all the time. I was born female, so I have been in sexist situations my whole life. I avoided going to male dominated gyms, going places by myself at night, etc. A few years ago, I adopted more masc, gender neutral styles but still think I experience sexism. I used to go to barbershops to get my hair cut, several male barbers all of different races purposely pushed my hairline back, across multiple locations. I guess I've become hyper independent...I've learned how to cut my own hair. 

Its honestly hard to determine the reason behind someone's prejudice or discrimination, as my identity is intersectional, as a Black, Fat, Non Binary, Queer, person. They may be in fact sexist, but they may also be racist, or homophobic, or fatphobic or a lovely cocktail of sorts. ",,,they/them/theirs,,"I rarely share my pronouns, it makes me uncomfortable. I don't like bringing attention to myself, especially in academic situations.

I was born female, and am visibly queer, I dress masc. So its mildly amusing and a little funny to see who will refer to me as they, versus she. When I don't disclose, it sort of works as a filter, identifying especially safe spaces, when people naturally refer to me as they. But ultimately I don't hold it against people, as its natural to assume in society, especially when I don't opt to share my pronouns. ","It makes me uncomfortable, especially when people self correct or over pronounce ""they"", mid sentence. I completely understand mistakes and have mistakenly screwed up other people's pronouns myself a few times. Convincing people who try, that I am not mad or offended is whats exhausting. I rather they just misgender me, than double back to apologize. And when I already stand out, I just hate the extra fuss & attention. ",,"My identity is intersectional, being Black, Fat, Queer, Non Binary, and Nero-Divergent. People don't often tailor spaces to be accepting to all intersectional perspectives. So experiencing racism & or fat phobia in feminist spaces or sexism &or homophobia in Pro-Black spaces, for example is a different kind of hurt. "

","I come from a wealthy neighborhood (Wilmette) even though I am not wealthy. I am also a woman of color. So I have made sure I perfect+enunciate my speech, dress classily at all times, that I carry myself in high regard at all times, and that I am seen as someone of standard. I started experiencing classism since middle school because people assumed that because I am a brown-skinned person of color, that I would be poor or uneducated. Because I live in the wealthy and most times racist Northshore, I experience classism pretty frequently and as I am getting older and being seen as older, the frequency of classism/racism I am experiencing is more often than not. Now I make sure to dress in brands that people around here dress in, when before I used to not. I also definitely will hide the fact that I am from a single parent household and I also don’t mention class or race that much, but I will mention things that “signify” my class, such as that I am going to study law or that I shop organic at Whole Foods. ","I am mixed. My mom is an immigrant from Libya but she is also half Syrian. My dad is from India. So I am half Arab half Indian- I generally say Libyan and Indian. Racially, I am considered half White half Asian. ","From the get-go, my mom named me an Italian name so that way I would not experience resume discrimination the way she and her family does (I still experience it though because of my ethnic surname). I also do not mention my religion (Islam) when speaking to people who aren’t seemingly of my religion. Even though I am in many high positions in many cultural organizations, I do not list them on my resume. I don’t wear colors that seem “ethnic” - deep reds, yellows, etc, and I opt for more “European” colors such as blues, white, black, gray, and pastel peaches and pinks. I used to straighten my hair for job interviews and work events but now I keep it curly. I definitely don’t mention my ethnicity, religion, or anything about international politics. I also always talk in a very midwestern American accent, and I American-ize words or country names even though I know how to say them correctly in their original language. Sometimes I’ll code switch and talk in a slight valley girl accent about trivial things such as celebrities or pop culture or shopping if I am with white people. If I am not with people who are of my ethnic group or religion, I become very conscious of my behavior. As someone who wants to be taken seriously and who wants to go into law school and law, I have to be aware of my behavior and how I come off. People are quick to label me aggressive, feisty, low-class, dumb, etc. There are more structures in place to keep women of color down than other groups. I try not to seem “ethnic.” When I am older and more established, I will go ahead and be my full self but right now I am just starting my career and I don’t want anything to get in the way. ","I follow Islam but more moderately. I generally don’t follow all of the daily rituals and customs that are supposed to be followed. However, I do hold Islam to be my religion and my belief system. ","I don’t mention that I’m Muslim unless the circumstance calls for it. My surname is very Muslim and telling but sometimes people don’t realize it’s a Muslim name and they hear my first name and think I am Christian or Jewish instead. I generally just don’t bring up my religion or am very hesitant to bring it up just because of all the many associated connotations.

I become very hyper, talkative, and incredibly impulsive, especially when I am overstimulated and on sugar. I fully mask and it’s way easier to mask when I’m not on sugar. ",Woman,"I make sure that I am always on top of my game when it comes to politics, sports and other topics of daily conversation. I also wear glasses when I go to work or professional events so I can be taken more seriously. I also keep myself very educated and up to date on popular topics.

I am multi-ethnic so I don’t always feel like I am fully with Middle Easterners or fully with South Asians. But when I am in a group of Muslims, all of different ethnicities, I feel connected. Whenever I am in groups of all types of ethnicities, I feel like I belong, not just when I am with Muslims. ","In the US, race is a massive differentiator but I feel that class needs to be discussed more. As someone with immigrant parents, and lived the first half of my life in the South Side of Chicago, the second and greater half of my life in the Northshore, and who goes to DePaul where it’s a mix of all, I see that class and socioeconomic background affects everyone more than they realize it. I am not wealthy but I grew up in a wealthy area, so I have had the privilege of seeing and learning the subtle coding and language used to differentiate classes. I know the nuances and can act accordingly, but people of lower socioeconomic statuses don’t generally learn those nuances and that creates barriers to class mobility. "

It’s always ok to change paths later down the line if the path you thought was right at one point is no longer the path you see for yourself as you’ve grown older.
